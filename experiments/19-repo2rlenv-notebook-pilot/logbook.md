# Notebook-to-task upstream pilot

## 2026-10-09: source inspection and intake

Baseline: BioTasks main `2a1950d239f1ada467c35393991dac87debe35f7`.
Research branch: `codex/research/19-repo2rlenv-notebook-pilot`.
No generation, solver, cloud provisioning or publication has occurred for this pilot.

Inspect Repo2RLEnv at `55554430cd724efded1f5ad0ff98ebca5d88c0a6`.
Start from SETA Seed2Synth and its shared quality loop, not the earlier factory.
The source already implements direct structured authoring, task emission, bounded
repairs, offline Harbor execution, quality reports and release tooling.

### Endpoint integration finding

`src/repo2rlenv/llm.py` accepts `LLMSpec.endpoint` and an explicit API-key environment
variable. It sends JSON-schema response requests through LiteLLM with zero retries.
Compatibility with the approved GLM service is not yet tested.

`src/repo2rlenv/execution/harbor.py:run_trial` explicitly rejects custom endpoints
for blind trials, permits direct OpenAI/Anthropic providers, and forwards only
provider API keys. This is a controller restriction, not a demonstrated GLM or
Harbor incompatibility. Recommend retaining Terminus-2 and proposing narrow
endpoint forwarding, with regression tests for credential isolation and the
unchanged offline task network. User asked where the patch would live and why it
is needed; adoption is pending. Proposed location: a versioned patch in this
experiment, applied to the pinned dependency. No fork or patch applied yet.

`OfflineDockerEnvironment` pins Harbor 0.22.0, runs only on the remote worker,
requires no-network policies in every phase and uses an isolated Docker network
namespace. Live enforcement remains unverified. Do not substitute a current Pi
integration without verifying the service's tokenizer compatibility.

### Notebook intake

Added a small reusable Jupyter-to-SETA seed converter. Preserve ordered markdown,
code and raw cell source plus revision/hash/license; omit notebook outputs and
metadata. Reject oversized or malformed inputs rather than silently truncate.
It does not author scientific tasks or establish fidelity. Source text is author
input; the complete notebook must not automatically become solver-visible data.

Candidate: Scanpy PBMC3k tutorial at
`8c1463d5d97272d5811ad3f4efb57483e23b4c7e`,
`docs/tutorials/basics/clustering-2017.ipynb`.
Inspected the actual notebook code. Its QC/filtering/normalization section is a
plausible compact analysis; full clustering is outside the proposed pilot scope.
Prefer the full observed input matrix initially, subject to resource measurement,
rather than silently subset cells and change filtering results. Software choice
remains open. Candidate selection is not yet agreed.

The 10x PBMC3k primary dataset page was read live and states 2,700 cells from a
healthy donor, same donor as PBMC6k, Cell Ranger 1.1.0, CC BY 4.0:
https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/3-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-1-standard-1-1-0
Retain attribution and donor relationship in provenance. Source repository license
was fetched separately; data permission is not inferred from the code license.

The earlier bedtools intake recorded enhancers extending beyond the supplied
chromosome length. Do not silently fix that source or presume coordinate-assembly
compatibility. This makes it less suitable as the first minimal pilot.

### Remaining pre-execution decisions

Agree notebook and any reductions, solver integration, backend and resource/time/
request budget after inspection. Upstream worker defaults: 2 CPU, 4096 MB, 10 GB,
3600 seconds. These are defaults, not approved ceilings or a wall-clock guarantee.
Daytona worker uses Docker within the sandbox; Docker readiness and model-service
reachability must be checked before generation. Model dollar-cost estimates alone
cannot enforce a request bound for a free/unknown model. Preserve the agreed build,
repair and solver attempt limits with explicit accounting.

Focused intake checks: four tests passed; Ruff formatting/lint passed. Executed
2026-10-09 21:29:53 UTC, peak RSS 33,392 KiB, exit 0, under the shared heavy-work
lock with one worker/thread limits (estimated working set below 100 MiB).
A source-only conversion of the real notebook completed locally; this is intake
inspection, not a model call, task generation or biological execution.

## 2026-10-09: selected notebook and endpoint patch preparation

User approved Scanpy QC/filtering/normalization with the full observed input matrix.
The converted notebook source is 15,666 UTF-8 bytes; original notebook SHA256 is
`1d4e8b1cb3ef8423bb1c4bb6ad6228e4c54b2352b5d9e7f142619737e189f439`.
No generated artifacts or scientific task instructions have been manually authored.

Following discussion and the user's acknowledgment, prepared a versioned endpoint
patch rather than a fork. Pinned Harbor v0.22.0 source confirms Terminus accepts
`api_base` and `model_info`. Ten helper tests passed at 21:32:22 UTC; peak RSS
33,288 KiB, exit 0. Patch application and Python syntax checks passed. Estimated
working set below 100 MiB; shared lock and one-thread limits used. These checks are
not live endpoint or full upstream integration tests.

Read-only infrastructure inspection showed an additional execution-location
constraint. The endpoint patch is insufficient to establish end-to-end access.
Proposed retaining upstream generation/quality/release and adapting its execution
boundary: model-client host on Iris, offline tasks on Harbor's native Daytona
backend. Harbor v0.22.0 `src/harbor/environments/daytona/environment.py` exposes
no-network support. Actual enforcement remains to be tested. Requested agreement
before preparing the broader integration. No services, sandboxes or jobs launched.

The same read-only session confirmed all ten prior panel-005 jobs are terminal
(eight scheduler SUCCEEDED, two FAILED). Scheduler success does not prove task
validation or resource cleanup; collect their evidence separately without reruns.
Session finished before 21:34:28 UTC, elapsed 2.48 s, peak RSS 249,788 KiB, exit 0.
No automatic retries or new model calls occurred. Private routing details remain
outside the repository.
